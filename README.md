# SuperCMMS - The free and open source CMMS.

This repository will contain the backend codebase/database design of SuperCMMS (https://supercmms.com) - a free and open source Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS).

### What is being open sourced?
We are open sourcing the backend code. Every organization has unique requirements for CMMS and a single frontend UI will not suit all. Therefore, any frontend code is beyond the scope of this effort. The idea is for organizations to use this backend architecture and build a frontend on it that suits their specific requirements.

### IMPORTANT! SuperCMMS is very much a work in progress.
This project is in a rapid state of development. The objective is to give you a robust backend codebase with key components generally expected from any CMMS, allowing you to focus on the UI and the actual app business requirements specific to your organization. We are currently in the process of branching out our internal codebase and removing proprietary/sensitive information so we can release the first version of the codebase. Star and Watch the repository to receive updates.

Please note it will be some time before the open source version reaches production readiness (Ver. 1.0).
