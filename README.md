# SuperCMMS - The free and open source CMMS.

This repository will contain the backend codebase/database design of SuperCMMS (https://supercmms.com) - a free and open source Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS).

>**IMPORTANT:** This project is in a rapid state of development. The objective is to give you a robust backend codebase with key components generally expected from any CMMS, allowing you to focus on the UI and the actual app business requirements specific to your organization. We are currently in the process of branching out our internal codebase and removing proprietary/sensitive information so we can release the first version of the codebase. Star and Watch the repository to receive updates.
